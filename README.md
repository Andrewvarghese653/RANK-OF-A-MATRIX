# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
we have to intialise program using import numpy to perform mathematical calculation
### Step 2: 
THe input from the user is stored in the variable a
### Step 3: 
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: 
end of the program
## Program:
```python
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: ANDREW VARGHESE VS
#RegisterNumber:23013668
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]])
B = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(B)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
